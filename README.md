The file df.R in the 01 folder was used to query and store our desired subsets of the Titanic data into csv files. The csv files located in the same folder are the subsets actually used in visualizations.
Namely, titanic.csv contains the entire set;
titanic_sex.csv filters out "null" sex passengers
titanic_sex_age.csv additionally restricts passenger age to <=10

All programs are designed to be executed in R from within the main project directory.
